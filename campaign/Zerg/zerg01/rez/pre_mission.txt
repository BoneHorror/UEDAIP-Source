ZERG CAMPAIGN: OVERMIND

Zerg Swarms crushed meager human resistance and laid waste to nine of the thirteen Terran worlds. 

During the assault upon the Terran capitol world of Tarsonis, the Protoss who have chased the Swarm across the Terran sector have finally met their match. They failed to engage the main force of the Zerg and are being forced to withdraw, with the hope of regrouping somewhere at the edge of the star system. 

As several Cerebrates weed out the remaining Terran forces, the remainder of Swarm's Broods prepares to move onto the next stage of their master's plan.
