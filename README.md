# UEDAIP Source - DEPRECATED BRANCH
 Source files of the UEDAIP mod - note that the main branch is DEPRECATED, and development is now exclusively ongoing for x64 and vanilla/beyond variations.

Each branch can be used to build a working UEDAIP executable with Samase

COMPILING

You can use https://github.com/BoneHorror/sezam to compile an executable from this repository. Sezam is a simple GUI program that will allow you to launch UEDAIP directly-from-folder or compile it to a SECASC.
